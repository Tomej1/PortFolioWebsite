								<b>Introduction</b></br>
								I worked on the fighting implementation and how it executed in the game, creating codes that would connect animations with the players inputs to show flashy combos. 
								I also created behaviour patterns for different bosses the player could face with a focus of making the fights more challenging and complex the more the player progressed in the game.

								<b>Functionality of the torch</b></br>

								<b>• I created</b> the functionality of the torch in the game. The torch is the main mechanic in the game. The player is required to keep the torch lit all the time in the game, if 
								the torch burns out the monsters will kill the player. The player can claim areas in the game by lighting torches on the wall along the cave, this will create safe zones for the player. 
								Shown in the video below. The player is safe as long as they are inside the zone of the light. The fire would eventually burn out if not reignited, which forced the player to move forward in the level.

								<b>• To create</b> a feeling of horror, I decided to implement a monster (oilbaby) that would creep closer to the player depending on how much the players torch was burning (light source). 
								This would create a sence of anxiety and distress as the game got darker the monster would come closer and start crying loud. This was done by simply marking the player as the 
								monsters target and simply allow it to move closer to the player depending on the light source in the players torch fire.

								<b>Character controller and soundeffects</b></br>
								At the end of the project I worked on implementing sounds for walking, running, slow breathing and hard breathing to make the game more interactive. This was fun to work with and it made 
								the game seem more alive. I created scripts that would play certain sounds depending on the players actions. All of these mechanics are shown in the gameplay video below aswell as in the script images.

								<b>Menu functionality and save system functionality</b></br>
								In the project we wanted the player to be able to find notes that would display information and clues about what might have happened previous explorers in the cave.
								So I created a simple menu system that that would show a collection of collectables that the player picked up. If the player picked up something it would get saved to a 
								json file so that even if the player died they could still keep their collectables in their inventory. Below is images and gif for how it works.
