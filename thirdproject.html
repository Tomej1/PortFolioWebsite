									<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>
									After hearing a rumor about a treasure deep down in a mysterious cave, where the treasure
									was said to be cursed, our explorer did not let himself be deterred from seeking it out. He fell
									down into the cave and found no way out. With only an unlit torch in his possession, he had
									to make his way through the cave that echoed with strange sounds. The cave was dark and
									menacing, but he had no choice but to venture inside. When he explored the cave, he came
									across a large area. He continued forward and stumbled upon a torn note from a previous
									explorer. On the note it said “if anyone comes across this cave, whatever you do. STAY IN
									THE LIGHT!”. The note was ominous, but the explorer had come too far to turn back now.

									<h3>My responsibilites</h3>
								<p>
									<b>1.</b> Functionality of the torch in the game, the main mechanic. The player recieves a torch which they are required to keep lit. 
									If not lit terrible things happen</br>
									<b>2.</b> Player movement and movement mechanics</br>
									<b>3.</b> Enemy AI behaviour and movement</br>
									<b>4.</b> Menu functionality and save system functionality</br>
								</p>
							<p>
								<h4>Nr 1: Functionality of the torch will be divided into several parts below</h4>
									<b>1.1 Torch functionality</b> The torch was the central mechanic of the game. This required it to work flawlessly so that the game was playable. In the game the player
									recieves a torch. This torch works as a safe zone for the player, as the fire keeps the monsters away. The player can spread this fire to unlit wall torches throughout the game in order 
									to create a new safe zone. Similar to capturing zones. These wall torches when lit will provide a safe space for a specific amount of time. I created dynamic codes that worked for all the torches were the player needs 
									to keep igniting and rekindeling their torches or else it burns out and the monster kills the player. The torches have vfx, sounds, lightsources which in combination creates a seemingly living flame. In the video shown 
									below you can see how the torches light up and slowly die out. The reignition of the torches work as long as the player can interact with the torches, this requires the player to be close by and the torch to still have uses left. 
									Please check code snippets below.
