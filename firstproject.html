									<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>Shura's Gauntlet is a fast paced boss rush fighting game, where the player has the freedom to choose the opponent they face in battle. Prove yourselves in battle and you will 
									be able to challenge even stronger opponents. </p>
								
								<h3>Project information</h3>
								<p>
									<li>Genre: Fighting , action
										<li>Project period: 10 weeks
											<li>Engine: Unity 3D
												<li>Group: 10 members
												</li>
								</p>
								<h3>My responsibilites and corresponding images</h3>
								<p>
									1. Fighting controls and mechanics<br />
									2. Connecting playerinputsystem to multiple controls for extra accessability <br />
									3. Displaying information about the fighting and tutorial showcase <br />
									4. AI behaviour and animations<br />

								</p>
								<p>
									<b>1.</b> The Fighting mechanics were created for fast paced and interactive combat. In order to make the game more enjoyable different combo sequences were made. By creating lists and
									dictionaries the program could handle all the players inputs in order to display the specific fighting combos aswell as animations. The following images show how I through code was able to connect
									specific inputs from multiple devices with certain combo outputs. Since just creating standard attack patterns did not feel engaging enough for the player I choose to also add in combo follow up systems,
									which matched the players inputs with button inputs in the combo lists in order to execute additional attacks. This makes it so that the combos keeps being performed as long as the player presses the buttons
									and the combo is a viable combo in the lists, if not the combo is cleared and the player can start new attack patterns.

									<b>2.</b> I created an inputsystem that was dynamic depending on what scene the player was in. If the player is in the main hubscene of the world, certain movement controls would be used.
								If the player then engaged with a boss a new inputsystem would load which loaded in the specific movement controlles the fighting required. Following are the code snippets for the inputsystem.

								<h3>Main take aways from the project</h3>
								<p>
									I was responsible for creating a fast paced fighting system for the player and the AI-characters. This project was extremely fun for me to make
									since i had no prior knowledge when it came to coding fighting mechanics. This required me to make tons of research while doing alot of trial and error.
									The fighting was created from a playerinputsystem which took information from the players input and checked those inputs through list of fighting inputs in order
									to match it with the correct action. This made the fighting system in the game responsive and expansive since it allowed for continious implementation of more fighting movesets.

									I realized during this project that playtesting is one of the most crucial things when creating games. As the fighting system which i created and implemented worked very well in the Unity engine builder
									it did not quite give the desired result in the build version of the game. This is something I look forward to improving in the future as well as programming and creating fun and interesting systems for future games.

								<h3>What comes next</h3>
								<p>
									I am always looking to improve the mechanics I have created for games. I know this fighting system is not perfect, and I would if given more time improve upon the smoothness
									of the fighting. Fighting mechanics and combo outputs are the most crucial part of a fighting game, which requires it to be perfect. In the future i hope top work on more projects similar to this
									were intricate systems and their implementation gives the player a fun and engaging experience!
