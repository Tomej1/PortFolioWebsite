									<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>Shura's Gauntlet is a fast paced boss rush fighting game, where the player has the freedom to choose the opponent they face in battle. Prove yourselves in battle and you will 
									be able to challenge even stronger opponents. </p>
								
								<h3>Project information</h3>
								<p>
									<li>Genre: Fighting , action
										<li>Project period: 10 weeks
											<li>Engine: Unity 3D
												<li>Group: 10 members
												</li>
								</p>
								<h3>My responsibilites and corresponding images</h3>
								<p>
									1. Fighting controls and mechanics<br />
									2. Connecting playerinputsystem to multiple controls for extra accessability <br />
									3. Displaying information about the fighting and tutorial showcase <br />
									4. AI behaviour and animations<br />

								</p>
								<p>
									<b>1.</b> The Fighting mechanics were created for fast paced and interactive combat. In order to make the game more enjoyable different combo sequences were made. By creating lists and
									dictionaries the program could handle all the players inputs in order to display the specific fighting combos aswell as animations. The following images show how I through code was able to connect
									specific inputs from multiple devices with certain combo outputs. Since just creating standard attack patterns did not feel engaging enough for the player I choose to also add in combo follow up systems,
									which matched the players inputs with button inputs in the combo lists in order to execute additional attacks. This makes it so that the combos keeps being performed as long as the player presses the buttons
									and the combo is a viable combo in the lists, if not the combo is cleared and the player can start new attack patterns.

								<p>
									<b>2.</b> I created an inputsystem that was dynamic depending on what scene the player was in. If the player is in the main hubscene of the world, certain movement controls would be used.
								If the player then engaged with a boss a new inputsystem would load which loaded in the specific movement controlles the fighting required. Following are the code snippets for the inputsystem.

								</p>
								<p>
									<b>3.</b> I created a scene in the game which purpose was to showcase the different combos in the game for the player to see. Since this scene would display the fighting combos
									, I thought it would be appropriate to do so in a flashing way. The scene can seen below in the youtube video. The showcase shows the camera spinning around the main character 
									in the game and showing the specific combo that the player presses. This was done through Unity canvas and code connected with certain animations.

									<b>4.</b> In a fighting game one of the most important parts are the enemies that the player faces and how they behave and fight. I worked rigidly to create a behaviour for the 
									AI which would make for an interesting opponent. I created states for the AI which determined what their actions would be (Check code snippets below). Since we had multiple opponents I wanted to 
									make every fight interesting in its own way and provide the player with new challenges. The first 2 bosses that the player faces have simple and similar attack patterns. However as the player advances in the game 
									the AI recieves new attacks as shown below in the code snippets. In the pictures you can also see that I created a list of attacks that the AI could perform and determined the next attack animation according to the attack chosen. 
									This made it so that the later bosses and the last boss have a more variety of attacks which makes the challenge much harder for the player.

								<h3>What comes next</h3>
								<p>
									I am always looking to improve the mechanics I have created for games. I know this fighting system is not perfect, and I would if given more time improve upon the smoothness
									of the fighting. Fighting mechanics and combo outputs are the most crucial part of a fighting game, which requires it to be perfect. In the future i hope top work on more projects similar to this
									were intricate systems and their implementation gives the player a fun and engaging experience!
