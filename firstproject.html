									<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>Shura's Gauntlet is a fast paced boss rush fighting game, where the player has the freedom to choose the opponent they face in battle. Prove yourselves in battle and you will 
									be able to challenge even stronger opponents. </p>
								
								<h3>Project information</h3>
								<p>
									<li>Genre: Fighting , action
										<li>Project period: 10 weeks
											<li>Engine: Unity 3D
												<li>Group: 10 members
												</li>
								</p>
								<h3>My responsibilites</h3>
								<p>
									<li>Fighting controls and mechanics<br />
										<li>Connecting playerinputsystem to multiple controls for extra accessability <br />
											<li>Create satisfactory combosystems and outputs <br />
												<li>Displaying information about the fighting and tutorial showcase <br />
													<li>AI behaviour<br /></li>
								</p>
								<h3>Main take aways from the project</h3>
								<p>
									I was responsible for creating a fast paced fighting system for the player and the AI-characters. This project was extremely fun for me to make
									since i had no prior knowledge when it came to coding fighting mechanics. This required me to make tons of research while doing alot of trial and error.
									The fighting was created from a playerinputsystem which took information from the players input and checked those inputs through list of fighting inputs in order
									to match it with the correct action. This made the fighting system in the game responsive and expansive since it allowed for continious implementation of more fighting movesets.

									I realized during this project that playtesting is one of the most crucial things when creating games. As the fighting system which i created and implemented worked very well in the Unity engine builder
									it did not quite give the desired result in the build version of the game. This is something I look forward to improving in the future as well as programming and creating fun and interesting systems for future games.

								<h3>What comes next</h3>
								<p>
									I am always looking to improve the mechanics I have created for games. I know this fighting system is not perfect, and I would if given more time improve upon the smoothness
									of the fighting. Fighting mechanics and combo outputs are the most crucial part of a fighting game, which requires it to be perfect. In the future i hope top work on more projects similar to this
									were intricate systems and their implementation gives the player a fun and engaging experience!
